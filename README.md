Some kind of useless scripts I made. Don't expect all of this fully functioning properly. This is what I have at the moment:

| Script | Description | Usage |
| ------ | ----------- | ----- |
| Autobackup | Copy a file that you dragged every n minutes in a backup folder. | As a new instance. |
| echoc | Print lines in different colors for the foreground and background. Can display strings and the content of simple files. | Called from instance. |
