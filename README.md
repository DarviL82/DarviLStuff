# DarviLStuff
This is the repository that contains some scripts that I do when I'm bored or when I have nothing else to do. This is what I have at the moment:

| Script | Description | Usage | Type |
| ------ | ----------- | ----- | ---- |
| [ECHOC](https://github.com/L89David/DarviLStuff/blob/master/echoc.bat) | Print lines in different colors for the foreground and background. Can display strings and the content of files. | Called from instance | Batch |
| [PBAR](https://github.com/L89David/DarviLStuff/blob/master/pbar.bat) | Display nicely formatted progress bars easily. Customizable with different styles, and sizes. | Called from instance | Batch |
