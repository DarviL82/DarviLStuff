# DarviLStuff
This is the repository that contains some scripts that I do when I'm bored or when I have nothing else to do. This is what I have at the moment:

| Script | Description | Usage | Type |
| ------ | ----------- | ----- | ---- |
| echoc | Print lines in different colors for the foreground and background. Can display strings and the content of simple files. | Called from instance | Batch |
| Autobackup | Copy a file that you dragged every n minutes in a backup folder. | As a new instance | Batch |

**There's a wiki explaining the instalation and usage of this scripts here: https://github.com/L89David/DarviLStuff/wiki**
